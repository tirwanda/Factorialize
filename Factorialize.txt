In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n can be a tricky algorithm. In this article, Iâ€™m going to explain three approaches, first with the recursive function, second using a while loop and third using a for loop.

Algorithm Challenge

    Return the factorial of the provided integer.

    If the integer is represented with the letter n, a factorial is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

    Factorials are often represented with the shorthand notation n!

    For example: 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120
    
    

function factorialize(num) {
  return num;
}
factorialize(5);
